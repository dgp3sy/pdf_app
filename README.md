# Annual Report Processor

Application to read scanned pdf documents of annual and quarterly report and prepare them for electronic filing. This is a project inspired by previous internship work in order to automate a process for companies in the future. Learn more about building this project by going to my [website](http://people.virginia.edu/~dgp3sy/python-processor.html).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Make sure you have python 3.6, and install the following packages: PyPDF2, pytesseract, PyPDF2, PIL

In order to install dependent packages, cd into your project's location path and run the following commands in the terminal:
```
pip install pytesseract
```
```
pip install PyPDF2
```
```
pip install pytesseract

Make sure that you have poppler and Tesseract-OCR added to your PATH. I found these resources helpful in doing this:
